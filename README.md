# Multithreaded_Proxy_Server

Overview

A multithreaded proxy server implemented in Python to handle concurrent client requests efficiently. This server acts as an intermediary between clients and the internet, forwarding requests and returning responses while optimizing performance through multithreading and caching.

Features

Concurrent Request Handling: Utilizes Python's threading module to manage multiple client connections simultaneously.

Caching Mechanism: Implements a caching layer to store frequently accessed resources and reduce latency.

HTTP Request Forwarding: Processes and forwards HTTP GET requests between clients and target servers.

Error Handling: Manages connection errors, timeouts, and invalid requests gracefully.

Logging: Records client requests and server responses for monitoring and debugging.

Technologies Used
